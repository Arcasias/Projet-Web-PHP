# Projet-Web-PHP
A project i made during my second year

### Made with Wamp and PhpMyAdmin

To correctly open this project, you'll have to get Wamp first and inject the .sql file into your local database. The login is configured as following :
- login : root
- password : root

### Known errors and mistakes

- Security is awful : simple injections can corrupt the website
- Passwords displayed as plain text
- The code could make a good use of a DAO method
- Aesthetics is quite precarious. Could be widely improved

#### Note that these haven't been fixed since this was made as a project for my PHP courses. I haven't worked on it since then.
